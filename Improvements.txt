Firstly there is a small error in the script file. (Line number - 21 --> if (order.taxes_applicable == true) {  No variable or object called order)

Assuming that order_object is miswritten as order on Line 21
Used the following test object to test the code - var order_object = {product_name: "Sony", price_level:"discount", price:500, markdown:2,discount_percentage:0.2, tax:3, taxes_applicable: true};

Ways to improve the code
------------------------

1. TASK - Minification of the code. (Reduce the code as much as possible which will in turn reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred to the browser)
2. Removing unnecessary variables, we can remove tax_str, total_str and html variables.
3. Declare all of the variables at a time at the beginning of the code. (Helps readability too)
4. Decreasing the if, else if statements as much as possible without changing the functionality of the code.
5. Decrease the number of '+' operations for appending text in the code wherever necessary. (Line number 17, 30, 32 & 33)
6. While adding two integers in a string typecasting should be taken care of. Can be done using parseInt function or using braces (x+y) (Line number - 30)
7. Decrease the number of operations for arithmetic operations by simplyfing it. (Line number 8 & 10)
8. Initializing the variable values, it will decrease the if, else statements drastically. (Line number 5, 11, 18 & 23)
